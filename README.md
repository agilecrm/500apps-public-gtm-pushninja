### Installation 
If your website integrates Google Tag Manager, adding web push to your site doesn't require any coding. All you'll have to do is add a new tag based on the NinjaPush community template published by Google.


1. Log in to Google Tag Manager, navigate your account and click on "Add a new tag".


2. Search for our community template "PushNinja by 500apps (Web Push Notifications)" in the "Community Template Gallery".


3. Add the template to your tag by clicking on "Add to Workspace".


4. Copy the key from the application and place it in the "PushNinja Key" field in your tag after the template is added.


5. Add a trigger by clicking on "Triggering" below the Tag and choose "All Pages".


6. Click on the Submit button in the upper right corner of the page.


7. Upload the PushNinja SDK file in the root directory of your website to customize your opt-ins. The default service worker will be used by the website if the SDK file is not uploaded.


8. Insert the Google Tag Manager script into your website and head over to your website to subscribe to the notifications.


9. Users will receive the default welcome message from the website after subscribing to the notifications.
